# rust-jwt-tool
JWT generator with UI, select specific projects from dropdown for template content.

Currently utilises hardcoded structs and enums for the projects so need to customize prior for each use case etc - future improvement will be reading in the templates from a file.

Currently expects secrets to already be base64 - future improvement will make this optional.
